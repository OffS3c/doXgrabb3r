# Description
Used to hack a windows computer (Linux too only if it's running in wine)  
and steal certain files from it.

# Detection
It's fully undetected to all the antiviruses of the world as of now.

# Working
When it starts, it searches the whole computer for files which are of 
certain extensions. If found, it uploads all those files to an FTP 
server of your choice.
After that, it quits. 

# HAPPY HACKING 3:)
